=== Module Description ===

This file contains the code for testing your Timeslot class.
For Part 1b of this assignment, you'll complete the test cases below
according to their given docstrings.

Notes:

1. You MAY add additional test cases beyond the ones we've started
   for you; just make sure that you use different names that don't conflict
   with the ones we've given you.
2. We are *not* grading this file with PythonTA.
