class Timeslot:
    """A single meeting time for a course section.

    Instance Attributes:
        - day: the day of the week when this timeslot meets.
            This is stored as an integer between 1 and 5, where
            1 represents Monday, 2 represents Tuesday, etc.
        - start: the starting time of this timeslot.
        - end: the ending time of this timeslot.

    Start and end times are represented as datetime.time objects. You may find the
    Python documentation useful: https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#time-objects

    Start and end times can have non-zero hours and minutes, but their "seconds" and "microseconds"
    attributes are 0. (These are encoded in representation invariants, and will help simplify
    the Timeslot.duration method.)

    We do NOT enforce that classes can only occur during certain hours of the day
    (e.g., between 9am and 9pm).

    Representation Invariants:
        - 1 <= self.day <= 5
        - self.start < self.end
        - self.start.seconds == 0 and self.start.microseconds == 0
        - self.end.seconds == 0 and self.end.microseconds == 0

        >>> my_timeslot = Timeslot(2, time(10), time(12, 30))
        >>> my_timeslot.duration()
        2.5

        Hints:
            - Read the representation invariants carefully!
            - Don't forget about minutes.
            - Don't perform any rounding (since this is not part of the function specification!)
