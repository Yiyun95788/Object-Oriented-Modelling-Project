        Hints:
            - This method is good review of Python dictionaries and lists.
            - You may find it helpful to copy-and-paste the example section data
              into the Python console (storing it in a variable) and then experiment
              with accessing the different parts.
            - Test the initialization of each attribute separately; section_code is easiest,
              followed by semester_code, and then timeslots.
            - You'll need to convert from milliseconds to datetime.time values.
              There are 1000 milliseconds in 1 second.
              We recommend creating a helper function to accomplish this task.
